How to Play
===========
Objective: Make your school a world-famous school!

Spend money to construct new rooms, or upgrade existing ones.

Manage different variables such as acceptance GPA or student tuition rates to
get more students or get more tuition per month.

Get good students to graduate to gain 'rep'. If a student's motivation reaches 0,
or his GPA falls too low, he will drop out, causing you to lose a student and also
lose some 'rep'.

Once you gain a certain amount of 'rep', you win!
